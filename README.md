# Executable Post

Skin in the game for social media with executable posts for Lens Protocol

## Why

Internet has very short lived memory and it is easy to just 🐂💩 your way through. It is time to cut through the weeds and put money where your mouth is. We need an option to support your online claims with actions.

## What

Executable post is a post with smart contract in one. We don't know now what is the final usecase so many iterations are needed. The general idea is that your posts will encompass a logic that will be evaluated at a later time. This can have many flavours:

- a bet
- a reminder
- a personal feedback loop
- a transfer to charity
